## LESS
I configured LESS for the project using `WebStorm` IDE, just added a watcher to compile LESS files within the project on file change.

The `.gitattributes` file is here to force git to use `LF` line separator whatever the your environment is, it's because LESS always compile in *LF*, whatever the git config is.
So it mess up git if you're using *CLRF* (Windows) because it flags files as modified that aren't.

Since all our `css` are generated, we need to push them only because they won't be regenerated by grunt (would take time,
I prefer to work faster and recompile files on change rather than recompiling every file on project start).
The compilation of bootstrap and font-awesome would take time if it were done every time.

It is possible to do as you prefer, that's my way. Using grunt would be a possibility too, and in this case you wouldn't need to track .css files.
